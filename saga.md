# gramify - hiss


+ Gramify is a inspiration of Instagram and will look mostly like Instagram, altghough I will be adding extra features, later in my project, this will be my first major project, which I am doing for my personal development. I still beleive myselef to be beginner in coding, ao the code may look bit lousy here and there ðŸ˜…, but I will try to follow standards, and learn the most by this project.

+ This project will follow feature first approach, based on CLEAN architecture by following SOLID principles. 

+ For state mangement, I plan to use bloc, although we would definitely can add other state managment package if needed, and we will us get_it for dependency injection.

+ I will use Supabase for my backend.

+ I will be building this application for mobile and web platform, so we will implement, responsive design.

+ I will use git for version control and as we all do, github for remote access.
